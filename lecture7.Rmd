## Monetary Policy Tools

Recall that we assume money supply ($M$) set by central bank (e.g. Federal Reserve System).

[Monetary Policy Basic](https://www.federalreserveeducation.org/about-the-fed/structure-and-functions/monetary-policy)

  - The Federal Reserveâ€™s three instruments of monetary policy are open market operations, the discount rate and reserve requirements.

    - Open market operations involve the buying and selling of government securities. Open market operations are flexible, and thus, the most frequently used tool of monetary policy.
    
      - Buying government securities to increase money supply, selling government securities to decrease money supply.

    - The discount rate is the interest rate charged by Federal Reserve Banks to depository institutions on short-term loans.
    
      - Cutting discount rate to increase money supply, raising discount rate to decrease money supply.

    - Reserve requirements are the portions of deposits that banks must maintain either in their vaults or on deposit at a Federal Reserve Bank.
    
      - Lower reserve ratio to increase money supply, higher reserve ratio to decrease money supply.

## Open Market Operation

Monetary policy made by Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the corresponding open market operation is implemented by Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

  - Set a target interest rate [federal funds rate](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), then adjust money supply through open market operation until interest rate fall into the target interval. (e.g. Buying bonds from consumers to boost their money on hand in IS-LM model)
