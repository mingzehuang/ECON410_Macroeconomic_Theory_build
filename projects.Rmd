### Midterm Project

  - Please take a look at the proposed infrastructure plan on [The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/). Most of items fall into the category of "Government consumption expenditures and gross investment" defined by [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/real-gdp-major-demand-category.htm)
  
  - Take a review on the analysis of fiscal policy by IS-LM model in lecture 6.
  
  - Please do the following work as your midterm project:
  
    - Rearrange the equation of IS relation and discuss how the IS curve will shift on the graph (Please draw the graph as well)
    
    - Put the LM curve on, discuss the shift of equilibrium (output and interest rate)
    
    - Explain the intuition of the effect of massive government spending($G$)
    
        - Starting from the direct effect on the goods market
        
        - Then go to indirect effect on financial market (money market)
        
    - To fund the massive government spending plan, the Administration propose tax hike as well. Discuss the possible effect of it ($T$). You may take a look at the discussion on [Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/biden-budget-proposals/)
    
**Minimum Requirement**: go to *google slides*, get add-on "MathType" (you need it to edit equation), choose a theme you like. then you can do your project following the listed steps. 

At least 4 slides:

  - One for rearranged equation; explanation and draw a graph to show the shift of IS curve.
  
  - One for IS-LM graph to show the shift of equilibrium and explanation.
  
  - One for intuition of two markets adjustments.
  
  - One for general discussion about the effect of possible tax hike.

### Final Project

  In Midterm Project, we analyze proposed infrastructure plan by IS-LM (short run) model. Now we extend our analysis to medium run by AS-AD model.
  
  - Take a review on the analysis of fiscal policy by AS-AD model in lecture 15.
  
  - Please do the following work in *google slides* as your midterm project:
  
    - First slide will be Title "ECON410: Final Project" and subtitle your name.

    - Copy the graph [No Bill](no_bill.png) as second slide. Assume COVID-19 recession makes Aggregate demand curve on the left of labor market equilibrium. If No new government spending bill passed, the economy will change in a way like the graph shows. In the third slide, please explain what's happening in this case according to the graph.
  
    - Copy the graph [Small Bill](small_bill.png) as fourth slide. If a small government spending bill passed, the economy will change in a way like the graph shows. In the fifth slide, please explain what's happening in this case according to the graph.
  
    - Copy the graph [Large Bill](large_bill.png) as sixth slide. If a large government spending bill passed, the economy will change in a way like the graph shows. In the seventh slide, please explain what's happening in this case according to the graph.
    
    - Note that it's an "infrastructure" bill rather than a general government spending bill. If the bill really focuses on "infrastructure" (investment), what's the effect on the economy in long run? Please put some general discussion on your last slide.
